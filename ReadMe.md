**Steps to Run our application**

**Step 1:** Clone Repo 
**Step 2:** Open folder, build and view in emulator<br>Ensure that your emulator has at least<br>
<ul>
    <li>Target API level 19 (KitKat) or higher </li>
    <li>Uses Android 4.4 or higher</li>
</ul>

Personally our emulator is 
<ul>
    <li>Pixel 5</li>
    <li>Lollipop</li>
    <li>Android 10.0</li>
</ul>

However, default emulator works fine as well 

**What our application does so far...**
<ul>
    <li>Can read and write to firestore Cloud</li>
    <li>Can Switch pages upon 'Log in'</li>
    <li>Basic methods of Caregiver class needed for database have been implemented </li>
</ul>
